# Hi there! 👋

I'm Shafaq, a Computer Science undergrad and aspiring software engineer based in India.  

I’m currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** at IIIT Jabalpur. I love building intelligent systems and impactful applications that blend **AI, full-stack development, and problem solving**.  

Some of my projects include:  
- 📰 **Fake News Detection App** – AI-powered cross-platform app that detects fake news across social media in real-time, handling 5K+ content checks per week.  
- 🎥 **Intelligent Video Surveillance System (IVSS)** – Multi-camera full-stack system with motion detection, YOLO-based object detection, and face recognition, complete with a live monitoring dashboard.  
- ✅ **To-Do List App** – A responsive task management app used by 100+ users to organize their productivity.  
- 💡 **Flask Quote Generator App** – A minimalist motivational quote generator serving 1K+ requests monthly.  

I’m passionate about **competitive programming** too — I’ve solved 700+ problems across LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank (5⭐ in C++).  

Outside of coding, I love **writing, creating art, singing, and learning new languages** (currently exploring German, Japanese, and Korean 🌏).
